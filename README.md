# Tic-Tac-Toe & Gomoku (Five-in-a-row)

This project is to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be transformed into a Gomoku game because they share similar characteristics. E.g. Two players in a game; Two kinds of pieces;Play in a square gameboard etc. The game is designed in object-oriented and a practice of my software design skills.

The Tic-Tac-Toe game functionality is tested manually but not for Gomoku. You can switch from playing the Tic-Tac-Toe to Gomoku by changing the BOARD_SIZE to 15 and WINNING_MATCHES to 5 at the beginning of the source cpp file.
